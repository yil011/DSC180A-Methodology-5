# Questions
## 1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
  - In this quarter, the most interesting topic covered this quarter seems to be the integration of Language Models like BERT in classification tasks, and the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in financial contexts, specifically in calculating cash scores based on user transactions.
## 2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
  - We would like to investigate the calculation procedure of Cash Score, which reflects the financial behavior and creditability of individual customers based on their transactions. Our proposal will be centered on the development of a machine-learning model for transaction category classification and the calculation of Cash Score. 
## 3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
  - A potential change to enhance the approach could be the incorporation of more advanced feature engineering techniques and the exploration of additional relevant features. 
## 4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
  - I think several advanced techniques could be integrated to enhance our performance and insights. I'm interested in exploring more sophisticated NLP methods like contextual embeddings (GPT) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) for deeper text analysis. Also, we want to try deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs for feature extraction and capturing time-based patterns.
