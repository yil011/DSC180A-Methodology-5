# Questions

## 3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
  - A potential change to enhance the approach could be the incorporation of more advanced feature engineering techniques and the exploration of additional relevant features. 
## 4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
  - I think several advanced techniques could be integrated to enhance our performance and insights. I'm interested in exploring more sophisticated NLP methods like contextual embeddings (GPT) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) for deeper text analysis. Also, we want to try deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs for feature extraction and capturing time-based patterns.
